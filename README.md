small project(NOTE: WONT BE SERIOUS AND NOT COMPLETED) to test my skills and run an asm code.
No syscalls, no GDT, no interrupts, no code segment and data segment changing. Nothing serious. 
The goal is not to be ran fast. Its an amateur thing.
TBH it would have been easier to be written on c/cpp, but the goal is to sharpen my python skills.
